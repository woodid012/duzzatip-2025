## Draft Strategy Tips

1. **Pick 2 is a gift for Ruck** - Max Gawn at 51.7 is the highest-scoring player in DuzzaTip scoring. Lock him in.
2. **Back-to-back pairs are your advantage** - Use picks 15/18, 31/34, 47/50 etc. to fill two needs in quick succession before other managers can react.
3. **Tackler and Ruck are the scarcest positions** - The dropoff after the top 5-6 players is massive. Secure your starters early.
4. **Midfielder is the deepest position** - You can find decent MIDs in later rounds. Don't overpay early.
5. **Forward positions (FF/TF/OFF) cluster together** - Many forwards score similarly across FF, TF, and OFF, giving you flexibility in how you slot them.
6. **Watch for Bounce Back picks** - Players like Hayden Young (only 6 games in 2025) and Kyle Langford (8 games) could be draft steals if others undervalue them based on 2025 alone.
